%Version 1.6.0 Release March 15, 2013
%
% Purposes of release: (1) Introduce new SDT routines: routines that fit 
%   ROC curve, determine standard errors of its parameters, goodness of the 
%   fit, and perform a model comparison to determine whether the ratio of 
%   standard deviations of signal and noise distributions equals 1 (or any 
%   other value). Also introduced 3AFC and MAFC oddity routines (2) Extend 
%   functionality of Psi method routines: when lapse rate is included in 
%   the posterior distribution it can now be assumed that gamma and lambda 
%   are equal (e.g., in bistable percept task in which both gamma and 
%   lambda can be thought of as estimating the lapse rate). User can also 
%   marginalize nuisance parameters such that expected entropy is 
%   determined across parameters of interest only.

% Version 1.8.1 Release December 2, 2015
%
% Minor maintenance. Upgrade PAL_PFBA_Fit, bug fixes, make code compatible 
% with 2nd Edition of 'Psychophysics: A Practical Introduction'
%
% PAL_AMRF_setupRF:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% initialized xMin and xMax to -Inf and Inf respectively
%
% PAL_PFBA_Fit:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% Any combination of the four parameters of the PF can now be freed. The
% format of the input and output arguments has changed. That is, 'old 
% style' usage is not compatible with 'new style' usage. For now, 
% PAL_PFBA_Fit will detect whether routine is used 'old style' or 'new 
% style' and act accordingly. 
%
% PAL_PFBA_Fit_OldStyle:
% Introduced/Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% This routine handles the 'old style' usage of PAL_PFBA_Fit (see entry
% above) and is essentially PAL_PFBA_Fit from earlier Palamedes version.
%
% PAL_PFML_BootstrapNonParametric:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% Removed functionality of 'maxTries' and 'rangeTries' options. Users 
% supplying these arguments will be encouraged to use 'searchGrid' option 
% instead.
%
% PAL_PFML_BootstrapParametric:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% Removed functionality of 'maxTries' and 'rangeTries' options. Users

% instead.
%
% PAL_PFML_Fit:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% output argument 'output' has new field output.seed that contains the seed 
% that was used for the Nelder-Mead Simplex search.
%
% PAL_PFML_GoodnessOfFit:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% Removed functionality of 'maxTries' and 'rangeTries' options. Users

% (was 'constrained').
%
% PAL_PFML_negLL:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% Evaluates to Inf when params(2) < 0. Keeps search away from negative 
% values for slope parameter.
%
% PAL_PFML_setupParametrizationStruct:
% Introduced: Palamedes version 1.8.1 (NP)
% Allows alternative spelling of PAL_PFML_setupParametrizationStruct
%
% PAL_PFML_setupParametrizationStruct:

% Version 1.8.2 Release June 22, 2016
%
% Purpose: Fix bug in PAL_AMPM_setupPM. Also: Introduce a minimal-code demo 
% program of basic psi-method (PAL_AMPM_Basic_Demo). PAL_AMPM_Demo updated 
% to use a custom prior.
%
% PAL_AMPM_setupPM:
% Modified: Palamedes version 1.8.2 (NP)
% Bug fix: User supplied prior was ignored when supplied with existing PM 
% in call to PAL_AMPM_setupPM, i.e., when first argument to
% PAL_AMPM_setupPM was a previously existing structure, e.g.: 
% PM = PAL_AMPM_setupPM(PM, 'prior',prior) %prior was ignored
% PM = PAL_AMPM_setupPM('prior',prior)     %prior was not ignored

% Version 1.9.0 Release September 18, 2018
%
% Purpose: (1) Introduce PAL_PFML_CheckLimits.m which checks whether fit
% performed by PAL_PFML_Fit.m corresponds to true global maximum or 
% whether a step function or constant function (either of which can be 
% approached to any degree of precision by sigmoidal function) exists that 
% has higher log likelihood. (2) Add option to MLDS routines to use Devinck 
% & Knoblauch's  2012 (JoV, 12, 19) version of model. (3) Minor 
% maintenance.
